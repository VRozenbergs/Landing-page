# Landing-page

For this project I will create an entire web page from a design I am provided with.
In this project I will have to use the skils what I have learned so far. My skills so far are:

- HTML (Creating websites structure)
- CSS (Styling elements, and position them with Flexbox)

## Below are two images:

###### Web page should look as in this image
